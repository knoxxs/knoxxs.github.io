Its been 5 years I am using linux and I am lazy person. So I am always trying to automate things and to use shortcuts. **Linux Trickies** is a series I am starting in which I will be sharing all those tips & tricks.

Using `cd ../../../../../../` to move out always pissed me. So today I automated it. Now to move 3 directories out you have to do `cdb 3`. That's it.

I explained the shortcut on [commandlinefu](http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/14345/cd-out-n-directories-to-move-n-level-out-of-current-directory).
