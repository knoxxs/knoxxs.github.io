## Module I: Light Through Lenses

### Topic I: Photography as a Visual Language
Four ways to think about images:
 - **Vantage point**: this is where we stand in respect to the subject
 - **Framing**: How we crop or position what is inside our frame
 - **Optical drawing**: lens or glass (light shifter/pusher)
 - **Time**: When we click and how long we click (shutter speed)

> Your own photography is never enough.

### Topic II: But Is it photography?

In portrait the eyes of he subject should be directly staring at us.


### Topic III: Photography & Light

> Photography is taking a 3d subject with depth, fell & texture to it and mapping it down on a 2d surface. Light is the way we create th third dimensionality.

When you change angle different things emerge because of light: texture, depth, dimensionality.

Two types of light (Depends on the photographer and the time of the day):
- Hard (when sun directly overhead, middle of the day. way to much details/definitions)
- Soft (Can create more dimensionality)


### Topic IV: Lens Opting & Seeing

> Technical skills are like vocabulary.

The bigger the focal length the bigger the object will look.
Auto Focus: accuracy


### Topic V: Vantage Point & Framing

- Though focus is the first this to step out things we want to give preference to, but Vantage point also plays an role.
- The height and angle. Remember the rule of || lines.
- Try to imagine where the photographer would be standing while looking at other photos.
- Mastering the delusion of view finder is must.


Topic VI:
---------

Aperture stop  = Actual diameter / focal length


Topic VII:
----------

Accuracy of exposure (tradeoff)
ISO - Sensitivity of the chip - higher means more intensified hence more noise


Topic VIII:
-----------

The world has no edges. So framing is very important to define a edge.
Two types of frame:
- Passive (When edges of the subject are fully contained in the image). The subject resides and rest there
- Active (Not directly opposite but it has some different relation to edges)

Check for the corners (they are longest visual cues in the image)
