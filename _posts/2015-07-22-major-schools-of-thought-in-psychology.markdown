After the last course from highbrow I joined this couse.

## Episode 1: Structuralism

### Origin

1. Developed by Wilhelm Wundt in the 1800s.
2. The first school of thought in psychology.
3. Edward B. Titchener is also strongly associated with this school of thought.

### Thought

1. Structuralists wanted to examine the adult mind in its smallest possible understandable pieces. Then they would determine how those pieces fit together to create thoughts and ideas.
2. It utilized the process of introspection, which involved trained observers’ careful descriptions in controlled conditions. The people involved were trained in how to describe their experiences using a very specific set of vocabulary.
3. Informal introspection is where an individual personally reflects on their own thoughts and feelings, but structuralists favored a more formal approach. 
4. Wundt’s and Titchener’s versions were slightly different—Wundt looked at the whole experience while Titchener was focused on breaking down the process into smaller pieces.

**Titchener's Thought**: Titchener argued that an experience should be considered a “fact,” which exists without considering the significance or value of the experience. He also argued that the only means of describing the conscious experience is based on these experiences – sensation and feeling (affection). The thought process was a result of those sensations, developed by experiencing a similar occurrence previously.

> As a science, however, critics argue that it is not very reliable because it is so subjective—especially its introspection methods.

This study brought up the understanding of difference between Sensation and Perception.

## Episode 2: Functionalism

### Origin

1. Functionalism was a competing school of thought that arrived shortly after Structuralism developed.
2. Influenced by the work of both Charles Darwin and William James. John Dewey, Harvey Carr, and John Angell were involved.

### Thought
1. While Structuralists considered the elements of consciousness, Functionalists focused on the underlying purpose of behavior and consciousness.
2. They concentrated their efforts on empirical, rational thought instead of an experimental approach, questioning the capabilities of the human mind instead of how they got those capabilities.
3. Functionalists argued that there was no basic structure to consciousness because it is constantly changing. That also meant, they argued, that attempting to “map consciousness” was a pointless endeavor.
4. Most scientists later agreed that the focus should be more on thought instead of attempting to build a common structure.
5. William James argued that the mind and consciousness would not exist unless they had some kind of adaptive purpose (showing the influence of Charles Darwin’s evolutionary theories). He argued, much like Darwin, that the mind developed because it served adaptive, practical purposes. That also meant, he argued, that psychology should focus on the practical implications of thought.
6. Functionalism also focused on individuals by assuming that everyone approaches thinking and problems differently. This idea laid the groundwork for more individualized education approaches.
7. It also led to the behaviorist school of thought later. Functionalists like John Dewey argued that thought creates behavior, so people should focus on studying behavior instead of trying to observe consciousness, which is extremely difficult to study.
