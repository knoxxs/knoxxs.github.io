After the last course from highbrow I joined this couse.

## Episode 1: Structuralism

### Origin

1. Developed by Wilhelm Wundt in the 1800s.
2. The first school of thought in psychology.
3. Edward B. Titchener is also strongly associated with this school of thought.

### Thought

1. Structuralists wanted to examine the adult mind in its smallest possible understandable pieces. Then they would determine how those pieces fit together to create thoughts and ideas.
2. It utilized the process of introspection, which involved trained observers’ careful descriptions in controlled conditions. The people involved were trained in how to describe their experiences using a very specific set of vocabulary.
3. Informal introspection is where an individual personally reflects on their own thoughts and feelings, but structuralists favored a more formal approach. 
4. Wundt’s and Titchener’s versions were slightly different—Wundt looked at the whole experience while Titchener was focused on breaking down the process into smaller pieces.

**Titchener's Thought**: Titchener argued that an experience should be considered a “fact,” which exists without considering the significance or value of the experience. He also argued that the only means of describing the conscious experience is based on these experiences – sensation and feeling (affection). The thought process was a result of those sensations, developed by experiencing a similar occurrence previously.

> As a science, however, critics argue that it is not very reliable because it is so subjective—especially its introspection methods.

This study brought up the understanding of difference between Sensation and Perception.

## Episode 2: Functionalism

### Origin

1. Functionalism was a competing school of thought that arrived shortly after Structuralism developed.
2. Influenced by the work of both Charles Darwin and William James. John Dewey, Harvey Carr, and John Angell were involved.

### Thought

1. While Structuralists considered the elements of consciousness, Functionalists focused on the underlying purpose of behavior and consciousness.
2. They concentrated their efforts on empirical, rational thought instead of an experimental approach, questioning the capabilities of the human mind instead of how they got those capabilities.
3. Functionalists argued that there was no basic structure to consciousness because it is constantly changing. That also meant, they argued, that attempting to “map consciousness” was a pointless endeavor.
4. Most scientists later agreed that the focus should be more on thought instead of attempting to build a common structure.
5. William James argued that the mind and consciousness would not exist unless they had some kind of adaptive purpose (showing the influence of Charles Darwin’s evolutionary theories). He argued, much like Darwin, that the mind developed because it served adaptive, practical purposes. That also meant, he argued, that psychology should focus on the practical implications of thought.
6. Functionalism also focused on individuals by assuming that everyone approaches thinking and problems differently. This idea laid the groundwork for more individualized education approaches.
7. It also led to the behaviorist school of thought later. Functionalists like John Dewey argued that thought creates behavior, so people should focus on studying behavior instead of trying to observe consciousness, which is extremely difficult to study.

## Episode 3: Psychoanalysis
Sigmund Freud founded psychoanalysis. He believed that people could deal with many of their mental ailments by bringing out repressed memories. That is, he wanted to make unconscious thoughts and feelings conscious so that people could deal with them. This process is commonly used to deal with anxiety and depression. He placed a great deal of focus on childhood memories and dreams because these were, he thought, manifestations of the unconscious mind.

Psychoanalysis operated upon several assumptions.

1. the theory assumes that all psychological problems have their origins in the unconscious mind.
2. symptoms are caused by these hidden disturbances in the unconscious mind.
3. the causes are usually related to repressed trauma or unresolved issues that occurred during childhood development.
4. Lastly, treatment’s focus is to bring out these repressed memories so that the person can deal with them in his or her conscious mind.

Freud would have his patients lie on a couch and discuss their childhood and dreams. He sat behind them taking notes, and he let them discuss openly. Freud attempted to be a listening figure and only contributed when needed. He did not share personal information with his patients and did not pass judgment. Classic psychoanalysis takes an extremely long time; Freud recommended between 2 to 5 sessions per week for a period of several years. Part of the reason that psychoanalysis was such a time-consuming process was that most people used defense mechanisms to deal with conflict. Example defense mechanisms include things like repression, denial, projection, displacement, and sublimation. Freud was not focused on a reduction of symptoms; he wanted to find and bring out the underlying problem. The similarities between Freud’s approach and modern therapy are fairly apparent.

Psychoanalysis can also involve the use of the Rorschach inkblot tests. This is a test where the subject is shown pictures of ink blots that are not supposed to any real picture, but the subject is asked what the inkblot resembles to them. It supposedly helps analysts determine what is in the subject’s unconscious thought processes.

# Episode 4: Evolutionary Psychology

1. Evolutionary psychology combines the concepts of natural selection and psychology.
2. It was strongly influenced by the work of Charles Darwin, it is sometimes referred to as Psychological Darwinism.
3. Evolutionary psychology is a way of thinking about psychology; it is not an area of study, like reasoning, social behavior, or vision would be.

Darwin believed that animals and humans evolved in a way that has allowed them to adapt to their environment. When the psychology portion is added in, the theory assumes that useful mental processes like *memory, language, and perception* were developed because they served a useful and adaptive purpose. Part of Darwin’s theory is that those who do not develop these traits will die out, and eventually only those organisms with the trait will survive. That concept is carried over into evolutionary psychology as well.

The focus in evolutionary psychology, then, is on determining the practical purpose of thought processes and using them in the best way possible. How has evolution shaped the mind and behavior over time? Technically, evolutionary psychology could be used on animals as well, but most of the research is on the development of humans.

Concepts of “instincts” and “human nature” have their roots in evolutionary psychology. While most believe that humans have lost the majority of their “natural instincts,” those instinctive thought process may still be in the unconscious mind, causing automatic or reflexive action in certain situations—particularly in dangerous situations. William James, a founding father of psychology, would argue that humans actually have more instincts, which allow them to thrive so much better than other animals. He argues that we may not realize that we have them because they work so well that they are virtually unnoticeable.

# Episode 5: Biological Psychology

1. biology + psychology.
2. It is a perspective to the study of psychology rather than a science in and of itself.
3. It is tied into the work of Charles Darwin and his observation of animals.
4. There are three methods that biological psychologists use to help learn about the human mind and human behavior.
    1. **Comparative method**: This method implies that certain species of animals can be studied and compared, but it also works on humans—that is, studying various individuals and then comparing their responses can help psychologists understand more about human behavior.
    2. **Physiology** is the study of how the nervous system and hormone functions affect human behavior. Physiology also considers how the brain works and how altering these functions or the structure of the brain can affect behavior.
    3. It consider how genetics or inheritance affects behavior or intelligence.
5. Lab experiments were extremely common, and they were often geared toward finding correlations between two comparable subjects. Because of this, researchers held twin studies frequently.
6. The work in this area helped develop comparative psychology as a field, and its basic methods were highly applicable in other areas of science.
7. Critics of the approach were concerned that too much reliance on humanism (development based on evolution as a human) meant that free will was virtually non-existent.
8. The school does not recognize cognitive processes and simply focuses on “natural” adaptations.
9. There was also some concern that this type of thought made very complex ideas (including physical systems) very simplistic, so much so that some had concerns about whether results generated by the method could be trusted.
