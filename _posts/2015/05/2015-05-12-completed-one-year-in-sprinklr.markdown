This is my first non-technical post. Today I completed 1 year in Sprinklr. So I decided I should try to judge my last year.

The one thing I am sure about the last year is, till now this is the most happening year in my life. This pretty much sums up the analysis of my last year to be positive. Today I was in very good mood for the complete day. I think that was the satisfaction of completing one year doing something and in which you learned the most in all years I have lived till now. There is a feeling of accomplishment in me. Whatever lets start the analysis. There are many things which I don't remember, but as I don't remember them, they might be not much important.

# Life Investment

Here I will put all the things which I consider investments for life time.

- It always comes first in my mind: **The value of hard work and time**. In Sprinklr me and Sprinklr both pushed me always beyond my expectation of hard work form myself. I think the only thing in your current life which will affect your future is **experience** and the only way to gain maximum experience is hard work. I have seen many people who consider the knowledge also with experience but then I ask myself what is knowledge. According to me, `knowledge is facts you learned + experience you gain`. In my case I usually forgets the facts in some time (yes, I am bit amnesiac), so only experience remains which matters. If you start doing hard work the you will realize you will always have less time and after some more hard work ever more less time. The thing is there is *never ending (literally)* things to do but *ending* time.
- **Software Programming**: Here I just want to mention that before Sprinklr I knew programming and now I know software programming. There are infinite things I learned in programming. I also learned that programming is very simple, its only **design** which matters and designs are just beautiful. Making your own design and understanding others design is my best pass time.
- **Life is playground else nothing**: This quote I learned from movie [Mr. Nobody](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0485947/). In my last year I realized that its true. You can always do anything in any amount of time but you just have to start. If you keep thinking how to start and planning things then time & opportunity might slip away. As a result of this quote I also follow **Move Fast & Break Things**. If you get confidence in this then you can start anything and can complete it.
- **Aim for big**: There is nothing to explain here, it is as simple as that just aim for big.
- **What Friends can do**: Something I gained to extreme last year is friendship. We are 8 friends living together. We have learnt many things from each other and have way too many memories to cherish in future. Whatever my mood is, they always makes me happy. Living with them is so good that I want it to never end.
- **Interacting with strangers**: I am always eager to interact with stranger, not very good at it, but improving. Last year I again tried interacting with many strangers but as usual in India very few responded, but those who did have helped in realizing this is good. I also realized more deeply that first judgements we make about any person are never true (another way of saying looks a re deceiving). Made some awesome strangers friends this year.
- **Travelling**: I also started travelling this year. In January I made a promise to travel to somewhere every month. This is what I did til then:
    - Jan - Gandhinagar (Convocation)
    - Feb - Dehradun (My first random backpack trip)
    - Mar - Nag Tibba (First Trekking)
    - April - Cousin's  Marriage (Have to go)
    - May - Another Cousin's Engagement (Have to go)
- **Snooker**: Its an awesome game. Will keep playing.
- **Swimming**: Did first time, now want to do regularly. Its very relaxing.
- **Running**: Again really enjoy running/jogging. Want to be very-very regular at this.
- **What ever you do, but you will always regret a fight**: Last year I also had a fight with a friend/acquaintance. We were doing something together and faced many moments of different opinions. On my end I was trying to stop it but from the other end I got the notice to stop. I got angry but I decided not to reply right now but after a week so that I emotional anger wouldn't affect my actions, but now I realize that one week was also less. So what is exact time one should wait to reply? Not sure. I realized that only, there is no right time to reply back to fight. Now in such situations I just want to follow this:

    > Never raise your voice, improve the argument.

Apart from all the things above the complete year I am trying to understand life. What is the best way tp live, how the current society developed to be this and stuff... This thing really get me frustrated but will keep fighting.

# To Change
- **Planning**: I need to start planning my life. Deciding goals and to be disciplined to achieve them. Always have to keep small goals so that after completing them I realize I have done something. Also keep changing the goals, as everyday we learn something new.
- **Health**: In this area I really need to improve. Given my dreams I am in very bad condition.
- **Travelling**: Have to travel more. Need to got to some alone trips.
- **More Strangers**: Many more, really like talking with them. Have to do something about it.
- **A new skill every year**: This is big level plan I have to make. I have to learn a new skill every year and have to become very good at it.


This year I really want to plan my life and have to do change it drastically. I am not happy with a normal life or with a consistent life.
