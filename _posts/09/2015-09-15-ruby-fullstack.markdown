So today I decided to learn Ruby and the Ruby on Rails (RoR) to follow a easy, very fast (we call it agile to sound big) path to become full-stack developer. In the end my goal to be a developer in ruby so that after having a idea in my mind it should take me a weekend to develop it with all basic features which I can also deploy.

In this post I will be documenting the complete path I will be following to learn it.

## Learning Ruby

1. [To Ruby From Java](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/ruby-from-other-languages/to-ruby-from-java/)
2. [Ruby in Twenty Minutes](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/)
3. [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)


## Learning Rails

## Sample bookmark app - 12devs

I followed [this great post](http://12devs.co.uk/articles/writing-a-web-application-with-ruby-on-rails/) to make a sample bookmark app using RoR. It will give you a feel of how fast the development can be and how much automation is prebuilt in RoR flow. After this tutorial I got really excited as being a Java developer myself, I can only imagine to setup 1 library in java in the time I build the complete bookmark app in RoR. Though following this article I got into some issue once or twice but a simple google search helped me. Following are some the links which can also help you.

1. [`undefined method merge!` error](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27611947/devise-raises-error-with-rails-4-2-upgrade)
2. [`users table not found` error](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22582772/rake-dbmigrate-doesnt-work-rails-4-0-4)

Though this article is good to realize the power of ruby but its not the best to understand it. So I have to find an article which explain things in deep.

## Ruby on rails tutorial - Michael Hartl

My notes for the same is captured in a [different post](http://knoxxs.github.io/programming/rails/learning/2015/09/22/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-michael-hartl/) as it was getting too long.
