- Underprivileged: Orphanages, Old age homes etc. 
- Money can help but relations is what they are missing (which made them underprivileged) and they need

### Syzygy

- A direct medium to communicate without any intermediary organisation.  
- Manages when and how they are connecting i.e. helping managing the relations.
- Can sprout a relation
