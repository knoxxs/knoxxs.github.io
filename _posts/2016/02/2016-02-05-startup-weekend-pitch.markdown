Its the my pitch for Syzygy.

### The problem

- Underprivileged: Orphanages, Old age homes etc. 
- Many are working to solve this with money but relations is what these people are missing (which made them underprivileged) and they need.

### Syzygy 

> means: a pair of connected or corresponding things.

- Provides a platform where you can connect with them
- The system takes care of the hassle of connecting with an organisation, so that you can take care of connecting with people  
- For you: it acts as a guide to help you manage relations at every step and for organisations: it provides a system to manage the relations- online & offline meetings.
- Can sprout a relation
