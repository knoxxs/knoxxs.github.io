Its the my pitch for Syzygy.

### [Speaking Exchange](http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/perfect-match-brazilian-kids-learn-english-video-chatting-lonely-elderly-americans-157523)

- The idea
- The impact
- Its a win-win situation

### The problem

- We
    - Want to do something, but don't really do something
    - Time is much more impact than money
- Them
    - Alone
    - Very less relations (after all they matters the most)
    - Can use a life guide

### Syzygy 

> means: a pair of connected or corresponding things.

- A network where both can come together
- A relation can sprout

### Me?

- Yet another person at 23. Want to do something meaningful and to help
- Graduated in 2014
- Worked for an year in Sprinklr
- Now working with Supertext for about 7 months
