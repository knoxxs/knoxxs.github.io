Its the my pitch for Syzygy.

### The problem

- Many people who don't have the luxury of having a family.
- There are many ways to help them financially but what is more important for them is someone's time.
- They need relations (which made them underprivileged initially)
- We can always help with our time.
- Can guide them towards their entire life.

### Syzygy 

> means: a pair of connected or corresponding things.

- Provides a platform where you can connect with them
- The system takes care of the hassle of connecting with an organisation, so that you can take care of connecting with people  
- For you: it acts as a guide to help you manage relations at every step and for organisations: it provides a system to manage the relations- online & offline meetings.
- Can sprout a relation
