Its the my pitch for Syzygy.

### The problem

- Underprivileged: Orphanages, Old age homes etc. 
- Money can help but relations is what they are missing (which made them underprivileged) and they need

### Syzygy 

> means: a pair of connected or corresponding things.

- A one point network where both can come together to talk and connect
- There relations can be scheduled and managed 
- A relation can sprout
