This year if the first year in my life when I could do anything I want. Prior to this year I was always following something school -> college -> job. But last year I left my job. Last six months passed very quickly and I felt that its too easy to waste the freedom I got. So I decided to plan year 2016.

Vipul suggested me to use [The spark's notebook](http://www.thesparknotebook.com/) to plan my year. I read the [guide](http://www.thesparknotebook.com/guide/) and follow the following blog posts [1](http://www.thesparknotebook.com/blog/2015/12/9/start-the-new-year-with-a-bang-week-1-of-4), [2](http://www.thesparknotebook.com/blog/2015/12/16/thinking-big-long-term), [3](http://www.thesparknotebook.com/blog/2016-theme-goals), [4](http://www.thesparknotebook.com/blog/2015/12/21/making-your-goals-your-reality-week-4-of-2016-planning). Here are my docs for the four blog posts ![1.Looking-Back-2015-Spark]({{ site.url }}assets/2016/02/controlling-2016/1.Looking-Back-2015-Spark.pdf), [2.Thinking-Big-2015-Spark.pdf]({{ site.url }}assets/2016/02/controlling-2016/2.Thinking-Big-2015-Spark.pdf), [3.Yearly-Theme-Goals-2015-Spark.pdf]({{ site.url }}assets/2016/02/controlling-2016/3.Yearly-Theme-Goals-2015-Spark.pdf), [4.Making-Things-Happen-2015-Spark.pdf]({{ site.url }}assets/2016/02/controlling-2016/4.Making-Things-Happen-2015-Spark.pdf).

So I planned my year and started following in from January. Following a planned year is good but tough. I was planning to write post about it from the start but never got time. I will write all the things I planned for this year. Let see in the end of this year how it turns out.
