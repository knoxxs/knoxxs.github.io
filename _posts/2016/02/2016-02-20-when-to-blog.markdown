This post covers my thought on when should I blog.

## The problem - Too [much work, less time]

From time to time I get this question in my mind to blog something or not. My current life is like this college (4 yrs) -> dev in Sprinklr (1 yr) -> Doing my own startup. This means I lear a lot daily. A lot means a lot. I can blog everything but I don't have time to blog. I have to spare time from my startup schedule to blog any recent post. Because of all these questions in my mind I decided to think of some philosophy which will give me a strategy to blog.
 
## Why should I blog

Before deciding the schedule to blog. I should be sure about whether should I spend time blogging or not. If I try to think in terms of [opportunity cost](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=opportunity+cost) I might be loosing a lot in spending time blogging something which I already know.


1. The other thing is I can't remember things for long. The things which I learnt in Sprinklr I am already forgetting those. Also I am exploring a lot daily, out of which more than half vanishes from my brain. So blogging helps me write my current knowledge about any topic, which I can grasp again in a overlook.
2. Also blogging helps me understand something in deep.
3. And after blogging something I get a good feel of satisfaction that I know the topic.
4. Also I can see what I have done in the past. Its like keeping a public journal (at least for it is, as I don't believe in keeping anything personal).

## The decision

So after thinking a lot I decided the following:

1. I should blog
2. If I am learning anything new then instead of writing a good blog post just write a rough draft full of links.
3. When I learn/do something second time, I should make that draft better to make them a good blog post.
4. If anytime I get free time I should convert these blog posts to tutorials.
