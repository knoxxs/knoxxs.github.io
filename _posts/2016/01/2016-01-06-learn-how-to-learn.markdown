In this post I will be making notes about coursera's course - [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/).

## Week 1

### Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

#### [Focused and diffused modes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/75EsZ/introduction-to-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes)

1. **Focused mode of thinking**: Good for familiar knowledge and work.
2. **Diffused mode of thinking**: Deals with a state of neural resting. Good for new thoughts and idea which you haven't thought before. This mode don't give you the finest answer. It just gives you the start means it will help you find the new patter in the neuron.

The important point to note is at a time you can be only in one mode of thinking.

#### [Focused v/s diffused thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/GVacn/using-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes-or-a-little-dali-will-do-you)

While leaning something new, you mind has to go back and forth between two learning modes. Little work everyday, gradually allowing yourself to grow neural scaffold to hang your thinking on.

#### [What is learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/7iJVR/what-is-learning)

1. What we learn over time is very difficult for computers to learn e.g. seeing, listening. But what we learn very fast like math and science is very easy for computer to do.
2. Most of the complex situation in the brain ar handled below the level of our consciousness. We don't need to know these heavy lifting in order to survive.
3. You are not the same person you were after a night's sleep or even a nap.

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

#### A Procrastination Preview
1. Procrastination occurs because if you don't like something a little bit, you activate areas of your brain associated with pain and then brain, naturally enough, looks for ways to stop this feeling by taking your attention to something else.
2. But research found that not long after people actually start working up what they didn't like the feeling goes away. This I used to call _first step reluctance_.
3. The solution is to take your attention to something pleasant thing momentarily. 

**Pomodoro**: 
25 minutes, no interruption focus. Then take a break.

#### Practice Makes Permanent     
It helps make neuron pattern strong. Use pomodoro daily for a brief period of time to do practice.
 
#### Introduction to Memory

1. **Long term memory**: when you try to think something you learned or did in past
    1. Too much capacity to store stuff, but you have to keep revisiting the patterns so that you know where it exists else they will be burried under other items.
    2. Here you store fundamental concepts and techniques. 
2. **Working memory**: When you are trying to hold some ideas in mind to understand a concept or to solve a problem. What you immediately and consciously processing in your mind. Also called _short term memory_.
    1. Working memory can hold four chunks of information at a time. We tend to automatically group memory items into chunks so that it automatically seems that our working memory is bigger.
    2. Techniques to remember something new or to sustain something in working memory: _Repetition_ (create more and new neurons) and _Closing your eyes_ (to keep any other items intruding working memory).

To move something from working memory to long term memory you need time and practice. Use **spaced repetition technique**:
M -> T -> W -> Not T -> F -> Not Sat -> Sun

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning
