In this post I will be making notes about coursera's course - [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/).

## Week 1

### [Focused and diffused modes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/75EsZ/introduction-to-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes)

1. **Focused mode of thinking**: Good for familiar knowledge and work.
2. **Diffused mode of thinking**: Deals with a state of neural resting. Good for new thoughts and idea which you haven't thought before. This mode don't give you the finest answer. It just gives you the start means it will help you find the new patter in the neuron.

The important point to note is at a time you can be only in one mode of thinking.

### [Focused v/s diffused thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/GVacn/using-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes-or-a-little-dali-will-do-you)

While leaning something new, you mind has to go back and forth between two learning modes. Little work everyday, gradually allowing yourself to grow neural scaffold to hang your thinking on.

### [What is learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/7iJVR/what-is-learning)

1. What we learn over time is very difficult for computers to learn e.g. seeing, listening. But what we learn very fast like math and science is very easy for computer to do.
2. Most of the complex situation in the brain ar handled below the level of our consciousness. We don't need to know these heavy lifting in order to survive.
3. You are not the same person you were after a night's sleep or even a nap.
