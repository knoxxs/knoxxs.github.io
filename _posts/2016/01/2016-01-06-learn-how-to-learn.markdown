In this post I will be making notes about coursera's course - [Learning how to learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/).

## Week 1

### Focused versus Diffuse Thinking

#### [Focused and diffused modes](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/75EsZ/introduction-to-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes)

1. **Focused mode of thinking**: Good for familiar knowledge and work.
2. **Diffused mode of thinking**: Deals with a state of neural resting. Good for new thoughts and idea which you haven't thought before. This mode don't give you the finest answer. It just gives you the start means it will help you find the new patter in the neuron.

The important point to note is at a time you can be only in one mode of thinking.

#### [Focused v/s diffused thinking](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/GVacn/using-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes-or-a-little-dali-will-do-you)

While leaning something new, you mind has to go back and forth between two learning modes. Little work everyday, gradually allowing yourself to grow neural scaffold to hang your thinking on.

#### [What is learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/7iJVR/what-is-learning)

1. What we learn over time is very difficult for computers to learn e.g. seeing, listening. But what we learn very fast like math and science is very easy for computer to do.
2. Most of the complex situation in the brain ar handled below the level of our consciousness. We don't need to know these heavy lifting in order to survive.
3. You are not the same person you were after a night's sleep or even a nap.

### Procrastination, Memory, and Sleep

#### [A Procrastination Preview](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/Dci3o/a-procrastination-preview)
1. Procrastination occurs because if you don't like something a little bit, you activate areas of your brain associated with pain and then brain, naturally enough, looks for ways to stop this feeling by taking your attention to something else.
2. But research found that not long after people actually start working up what they didn't like the feeling goes away. This I used to call _first step reluctance_.
3. The solution is to take your attention to something pleasant thing momentarily. 

**Pomodoro**: 
25 minutes, no interruption focus. Then take a break.

#### [Practice Makes Permanent](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/3YLAF/practice-makes-permanent)
It helps make neuron pattern strong. Use pomodoro daily for a brief period of time to do practice.
 
#### [Introduction to Memory](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn/lecture/X7E9r/introduction-to-memory)

1. **Long term memory**: when you try to think something you learned or did in past
    1. Too much capacity to store stuff, but you have to keep revisiting the patterns so that you know where it exists else they will be burried under other items.
    2. Here you store fundamental concepts and techniques. 
2. **Working memory**: When you are trying to hold some ideas in mind to understand a concept or to solve a problem. What you immediately and consciously processing in your mind. Also called _short term memory_.
    1. Working memory can hold four chunks of information at a time. We tend to automatically group memory items into chunks so that it automatically seems that our working memory is bigger.
    2. Techniques to remember something new or to sustain something in working memory: _Repetition_ (create more and new neurons) and _Closing your eyes_ (to keep any other items intruding working memory).

To move something from working memory to long term memory you need time and practice. Use *spaced repetition technique*:
M -> T -> W -> Not T -> F -> Not Sat -> Sun

#### The Importance of Sleep in Learning

1. Just being awake creates toxic product in your brain. When you sleep, your brain cells sleep -> unblocking the stream so that fluid can flow.
2. While sleeping, brain removes not so important patterns from the brain an strengthen important patterns more.
3. During sleep, brain also rehearse some of the tougher parts of whatever we are trying to learn.
4. Sleep is complete deactivation of conscious you in pre-frontal cortex, helps other areas of brain talking easily to one another.

1. Try to think of ideas while jogging.
2. Learn context switching


## Week 2

### Chunkingâ€”The Essentials

#### What is a Chunk?

>Analogy: Interlocking puzzle edges.
 
1. Chunking is the mental leap which helps you unite bits of information together through meaning. 
2. The new logical whole makes it easier to remember and also makes it easier to fit the chunk in larger picture
3. using four chunks in working memory, one can make connection to information that is present in various part of the brain. This is different from random connection of the diffused mode.
4. Focusing your connection to connect parts of the brain to tie together ideas is an important part of focused mode of learning. It also helps you get started in creating a chunk.
5. When you are stressed these connections doesn't work very well.
6. Chunks are pieces of information that are bound together through meaning or use.
7. These connected chunks, connecting abstract thoughts and ideas, are basis of science, literature and art.
8. A chunk is network of neurons that are used to firing together.
9. Focused practice and repetition helps you to create chunks. Step by step you can become the master by making small chunks big.
10. Focused practice and repetition is not the only thing you need to become a truly creative master of the material you are learning.
11. Once you chunk an idea, a concept or an action you don't need to remeber all the little underlying details. Eg. getting dressed in the morning.

#### How to Form a Chunk - Part 1

1. The best chunks are the ones that are so well ingrained, that you don't even have to consciously think about connecting the neural pattern together.
2. This is idea of moving complex ideas, movements or reactions into a single chunk.

#### How to Form a Chunk - Part 2

1. Chunking steps in every fields are little bit different.
2. Chunking of mental ideas (not physical body motions)
    1. Focus your undivided attention onto something you want learn. Because there are limited slots in working memory which you can use to reach other parts of brain to make ne patters as you are learning something new. In case non-complete focus some of the working memory chunks are not available, so you will be able to make less connections.
    2. Understand the basic idea you are trying to chunk. Synthesize the gist.
        - This can be done by taking turns of focused and diffused mode of thinking.
        - It creates broad encompassing traces in neuron which can link to other memory traces.
        - If you create a chunk, in case you don't understand, then that chunk would be useless. It won't relate to other material you are learning. 
        - Just understanding doesn't necessarily creates a chunk that you can easily call to mind later.
        - Reviewing or doing can help you do that. Closing everything and doing or solving what you understand.
    3. Gaining context so that you see not just how, but also when to use this chunk.
        - Context means going beyond the initial problem and seeing more broadly.
        - Repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated (so that you also know ehen not to use it) problems.
        - Practice
3. There are two ways to learn bottom up and top down. Both are important to master any subject. Context is where bottom up and top down learning meets.
