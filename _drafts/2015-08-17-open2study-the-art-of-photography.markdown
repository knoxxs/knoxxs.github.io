My notes for the [course](https://www.open2study.com/courses/the-art-of-photography) : The Art of photography by Dr. Shane Hulbert.


## Module I: Light Through Lenses
### Topic I: Photography as a Visual Language
Four ways to think about images:

 - **Vantage point**: this is where we stand in respect to the subject
 - **Framing**: How we crop or position what is inside our frame
 - **Optical drawing**: lens or glass (light shifter/pusher)
 - **Time**: When we click and how long we click (shutter speed)

> Your own photography is never enough.


### Topic II: But Is it photography?

In portrait the eyes of the subject should be directly staring at us.


### Topic III: Photography & Light

> Photography is taking a 3d subject with depth, feel & texture to it and mapping it down on a 2d surface. Light is the way we create the third dimensionality.

When you change angle different things emerge because of light: texture, depth, dimensionality.

Two types of light (Depends on the photographer and the time of the day):

- Hard (when sun directly overhead, middle of the day. way to much details/definitions)
- Soft (Can create more dimensionality)


### Topic IV: Lens Opting & Seeing

> Technical skills are like vocabulary.

The bigger the focal length the bigger the object will look.
Auto Focus: accuracy


### Topic V: Vantage Point & Framing

- Though focus is the first thing we use to stand out the things we want to give preference to, but Vantage point also plays an role.
- The height and angle. Remember the rule of || lines.
- Try to imagine where the photographer would be standing while looking at other photos.
- Mastering the delusion of view finder is must.


### Topic VI: Aperture & Shutter

- Aperture is the diameter from which light is entering
- Shutter speed is the time for which the sensor is receiving light.
- `Aperture stop / Maximum aperture = f/ ((Diameter of the actual physical lens cap) / (Focal length of the lend))`
- Bigger the number smaller the aperture and vice-versa.
- Bigger the number smaller the shutter speed and vice-versa. (1 inch is 1 second)


### Topic VII: Everything in Photography is a Trade Off

- Exposure is the combination of aperture and shutter speed.
- To decide if combination of aperture and shutter is correct then you have check if the highlights are highlights, shadows are shadows and the mid-tones are mid-tones.
- If f/8 and 1/125 is correct then:
    - f/8 and 1/250 is under exposed (-): This means shadows will be too dark, mid-tones probably be looking like shadows and highlights are not highlighted enough.
    - f/8 and 1/60 is over exposed (+): This means highlights will be too bright, mid-tones ... This will too much contrast or lacking of definition.
 - ISO(100 - 6400) is the sensitivity of the chip - higher means more intensified to capture very less light but more noise


### Topic VIII: The Order of Things: Image, Composition and Structure

- The world has no edges. So framing is very important to define a edge. Two types of frame:
    - Passive (When edges of the subject are fully contained in the image). The subject resides and rest there
    - Active (Not directly opposite but it has some different relation to edges)
- Check for the corners (they are longest visual cues in the image)

> Opposite to painter a photographer starts with the messiness in the world and find/creates order and structure in it.


### Topic IX: Translating: The Ordinary & Everyday

A camera gives power to translate the ordinary to something different. To give it new meaning.

## Assessment 1
 - *Hyperfocal distance* is a distance beyond which all objects can be brought into an "acceptable" focus or the closest distance at which a lens can be focused while keeping objects at infinity acceptably sharp.
    - Formula H = f^2/((f-number)(circle of confusion = 0.03) mm. Acceptable range is from H/2 to infinity.
